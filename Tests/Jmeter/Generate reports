One of the important in software testing is analysis - so if you did some load/stress or any other perfomance tests you need to analysis your results.
So you can check your results more insightfully by Jmeter options to displaying the results in different graphs.
To do this, use the appropriate commands in CMD

If you open CMD, then you need to :

jmeter -n -t "Files path which you want analysis" -l "Path where do you want to put the CSV file" -e -o "Path -where do you want to place the data folder - a dedicated index.html file will be created here"
